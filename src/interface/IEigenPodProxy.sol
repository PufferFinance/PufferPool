     * is to order the strategies *for which `msg.sender` is withdrawing 100% of their shares* from highest index in
     * `stakerStrategyList` to lowest index
     * @dev Note that if the withdrawal includes shares in the enshrined 'beaconChainETH' strategy, then it must *only* include shares in this strategy, and
     * `withdrawer` must match the caller's address. The first condition is because slashing of queued withdrawals cannot be guaranteed 
     * for Beacon Chain ETH (since we cannot trigger a withdrawal from the beacon chain through a smart contract) and the second condition is because shares in
